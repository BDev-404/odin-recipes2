    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>

    <p>Lasagna is a perfect dish for year round enjoyment. Bringing back the homestyle cooking that people love and delivering a from scratch meal with minimal prepwork and effort. The beauty of pasta an sauce continues to amaze me!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong>For a great lasagna I recommend a blend of ground veal and ground hamburger. But you can always just use some time proven 80/20 ground hamburger!</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and Garlic:</strong>For your onion, I recommend a basic white onion. You'll want about 1/2 onions per person you aim to serve. Fresh garlic is best, but to save time minced will work as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Products:</strong>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and a 16oz can of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong>This recipe is going to use fresh parsley, dired basil leaves, salt, italian seasoning, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles:</strong>I recommend bronze cut lasagna, Aldi has a great selection. Any store bought lasagna works.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make a rich melody.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong>An egg will help bind the cheese to have a more consistent structure.</li>
    </ul>
